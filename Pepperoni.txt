Pepperoni Pizza recipe 

16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)
1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)
18 to 20 slices pepperoni
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional
Flour for rolling and shaping dough
For the Quick Pizza Sauce:

1/2 cup tomato sauce (no salt)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic
1/2 teaspoon granulated onion
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 teaspoon olive oil
For the Honey Butter (Dad Add):

1/4 cup softened butter
2 tablespoons honey
